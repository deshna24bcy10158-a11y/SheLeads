# SheLeads
SheLeadsTech Hub 

This is a little web hub I built to bring together resources and opportunities for women in tech.
It’s got events, scholarships, mentorship sign-ups, a resource library, and even a lightweight chatbot.
I wanted it to feel simple, useful, and encouraging — not another boring static site.

✨ What’s inside

Responsive Navbar → shrinks down into a hamburger on mobile.

Dark Mode  → because who doesn’t love dark mode?

Events & Scholarships → currently mock data, but can be swapped with a real API later.

Mentorship Form → simple signup with toast notifications.
